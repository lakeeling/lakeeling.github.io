    <h2>My Degree Program</h2>
        <p id="first">Ever since I earned my master’s degree in library science from Mizzou in 2011, I always
        had a feeling I would be back to get my educational specialist degree. As the years flew
        by, the timing was never right for me to return to school. When my school was shut
        down due to the pandemic in March 2020, I wanted to help teachers and students make
        the move to online learning. I felt that I lacked the skills to be a successful technology
        leader. That is when I decided to return to Mizzou for my EdS in Learning Technologies
        and Design with a Technology in Schools emphasis.</p><br>

        <p class="refpara">This EdS degree program was the perfect choice for me. I have gained both the
        knowledge and confidence I needed to become a technology leader in my school. The
        two classes that had the biggest impact on me were Technology Leadership and
        Teaching Online Courses. The Technology Leadership class put me into the role of a
        technology leader and taught me the importance of thinking through all steps of any
        technology implementation. Teaching Online Courses gave me the chance to design
        and teach an online course. I was nervous about presenting my lesson, but it ended up
        being so much fun! It was the highlight of my degree program.</p><br>
    <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p class="refpara"> I can’t believe how quickly these past two years at Mizzou have gone. I won’t be a
        graduate student much longer, but I will continue to learn how to use technology to
        design learning for my students. I use what I have learned in this degree program every
        day. My school went 1:1 with Chromebooks last year. I now have the skills to step up
        and help my students and teachers. Education has changed so much due to the
        pandemic, and I know that online learning and the use of technology tools will always be
        an important part of teaching and learning. One of the most important benefits of this
        program was being able to experience online learning and use technology tools as both
        a teacher and a student. I am so thankful to have had this experience and will use all I
        have learned to make a difference in my school.</p><br>

        <p class="refpara">While I am very happy in my current role, I am open to the idea of making a career
        change. I think I would enjoy being an academic librarian. If an opportunity comes up, I
        know that I will be ready to go for it. I am prepared for any career path I decide to take
        thanks to my job experience and this degree program. I look forward to whatever the
        future holds!</p><br>
