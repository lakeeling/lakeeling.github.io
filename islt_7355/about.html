        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a high school library media specialist in
    Carthage, Missouri. I love helping my students find reading and research materials. The
    library is my favorite place to be! I like to read and learn about lots of different topics.</p>
    <p>I have a Master of Science in Human Development and Family Studies from The University of Arkansas. I also have a Master of Arts in Library Science from The University of Missouri. I am working on my Educational Specialist degree in Learning
    Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Technology in Schools. I am also working
    on an Online Educator Graduate Certificate. I plan to graduate from The University of
    Missouri in May 2022.</p>
