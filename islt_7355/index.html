    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio website! Thank you for taking the time to learn about me!</h2>
    <p>So, who am I? I am a high school library media specialist who has a passion for helping
    my students and coworkers find anything and everything they need to be successful.
    Whether it is helping a student select the perfect book, teaching a lesson on information
    literacy, offering technology help, or providing a quiet, safe space to relax, my goal is to
    make my library a place where everyone wants to be.<br><br>
    I designed this website to showcase my career and education. You’ll get to learn about
    me, what I have learned in my educational specialist degree program, and how I am
    applying that learning in my career. I’m excited to share a little bit about myself with you!</p>
