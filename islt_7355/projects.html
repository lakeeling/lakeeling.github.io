        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <p><b>Design and Development of Learning Systems (student) I am able to design and
        develop innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable learning technologies based on
        theory-grounded research.</b><br>
        Description: Introduction to Digital Media Final Project
        Students often need help finding a book to read when they come to the media center.
        Helping students find books is one of my favorite things to do. There are times when I
        am busy and can’t help them right away. There are also times when students don’t want
        to ask for help. Finding a book can be hard for students who don’t know what they are
        looking for. In the Introduction to Digital Media class, I created an activity students can
        use to help them find books. Students can use the activity to help them look for books in
        new ways and in new places. The activity is called “Three Easy Ways to Find a Book.”
        Students can choose to watch a video to learn how to search for a book in the catalog.
        They can also choose to listen to me explain why they should ask a teacher, librarian, or
        friend for help finding a book. I can put a link to this activity on my website or on my
        social media. The learning activity I designed helps students become more independent
        in the media center.<br>
        Reflection: In this class, we covered a large amount of digital media content including
        Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, iMovie, and Audacity and the why and how behind
        it all. I used all of these tools in my activity. I will be able to use a version of the project
        in my library media center. I would like to make this project more interactive so students
        can click on parts of the image for information.</p>

      <h2>Project 2</h2>
      <p><b>Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation (student) I developed critical and analytical
        skills for data collection and evaluation and can reflect and apply these skills to assess
        and evaluate learning systems.</b><br>
        Description: Instructional Systems Design Project
        The pandemic has shifted how K-12 schools meet students’ learning needs. The
        shutdown of 2020 forced teachers to quickly shift to online instruction with little to no
        training in how to teach online. Since then, Missouri schools are now allowed a certain
        number of Alternative Methods of Instruction (AMI) days for virtual instruction when they
        need to close for illness or weather. In the Instructional Systems Design course, my
        partner and I designed a project to help educators use Canva for instructional materials
        in combination with their learning management system Canvas. The goal was to
        streamline how materials are created and presented to students. Student data would be
        used to determine whether or not students benefited from this streamlined approach.
        The project allowed us to think through one of the possible ways we could help
        elementary school students, parents, and education stakeholders navigate the new
        world of virtual learning.<br>
        Reflection: After completing this project, I now have a general understanding of the
        instructional design process and a good foundation on which to build my knowledge on
        the subject. This project challenged me to work through the ADDIE Model and think
        about all steps of instructional design. My project, Canva in the Classroom, was the
        most extensive assignment I have completed so far in my EdS program. Luckily, I had
        an excellent project partner, and we worked well together to produce a quality project
        that I am proud of.</p>

      <h2>Project 3</h2>
        <p><b>Leadership & Social Responsibility (student) I developed competencies for socially
        responsible technology leadership.</b><br>
        Description: Technology to Enhance Learning Presentation
        In the Technology to Enhance Learning course, we gave a VoiceThread presentation to
        our classmates on a technology tool of our choosing. I chose to look for a new-to-me
        tool that I thought I and/or my coworkers might actually use in the future. I discovered
        Book Creator, a technology tool that allows teachers and students to create their own
        digital books, journals, reports, or portfolios. Students can easily collaborate with their
        classmates or with other students around the world. I enjoyed sharing this technology
        tool with my classmates and look forward to the possibility of sharing my presentation
        with teachers at my school.<br>
        Reflection: This assignment taught me how important it is to evaluate the strengths and
        weaknesses of technology tools before using them with students or sharing with
        teachers. It is more important to be able to learn about new technology tools than it is to
        try to become an expert in all of them. I will evaluate the resources I purchase for the
        media center differently and guide other teachers in their choice of technology tools. It
        will also help me ensure that we make ethical decisions about the types of tools we use
        and consider student privacy concerns.</p>
