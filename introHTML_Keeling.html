    Hello! My name is Lea Ann Keeling. I am a high school library media specialist in Carthage, Missouri. I love helping my students find reading and research materials. The library is my favorite place to be! I am working on my Educational Specialist in Learning Technologies and Design with an emphasis in Technology in Schools. I am also working on an Online Educator Graduate Certificate. I plan to graduate in May. I took one web design class several years ago but have very little coding experience. I use Weebly for my library website. In this course I expect to learn the basics of web design, and I am excited to create a website. I hope to use my new web development skills to customize my library website. In my free time, I like to read, watch the St. Louis Cardinals, and read while I watch the St. Louis Cardinals.
